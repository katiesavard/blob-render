### ‚ùóÔ∏è caution y'all‚ùóÔ∏è

This project is still **currently under development** and does contain bugs. Use at your own risk and please report unexpected behavior to [the author](mailto:katherine.savard@physics.ox.ac.uk). **Fully tested pipeline predicted to be ready for use early September 2025 -- watch this code (select 'Releases only') to be notified when the first stable version is available, as well as subsequent versions with wider capabilities**.

If you encounter problems with `pip install`-ing the project due to `casatools`, this may be due to OS incompatibility. See [this table in the casa docs](https://casadocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebooks/introduction.html#Compatibility) for a list of compatible OS/python version combinations. *In the future we plan on containerizing this part of the workflow to mitigate fatal sensitivity to OS/python combinations.*

## üí° quickstart example 

This software can take raw simulated data all the way to a realistic radio image with observing parameters of your choice. The first step is not necessary, and you may begin with your own image, as long as the units of the image are in emissivity (Jy) per pixel.

Default parameters for each step are stored in `configs/` as `default_simulation.yaml`, `default_MSbuilder.yaml`, and `default_prediction.yaml`. Command-line arguments overwrite these defaults. 

See [wiki page](https://github.com/katiesavard/blob-render/wiki) for more details on these steps, or follow the [tutorial section of the wiki](https://github.com/katiesavard/blob-render/wiki/Tutorial) with provided test data.  

Most of these steps can be feasibly performed on the average desktop computer, but the prediction step can be particularly intesive if measurement sets are large and we therefore recommend that this be installed and run on a computing cluster / HPC environment.


1) **Convert raw simulation data to an estimate of optically thin synchrotron emissivity:**

    ‚ÄºÔ∏è *this step is still highly specific to PLUTO .flt and .dbl files in cylindrical coordinates.* ‚ÄºÔ∏è


    ‚ÄºÔ∏è *Not fit for general use (yet), use at your own caution* ‚ÄºÔ∏è

    Store simulation files in `sim_data` in a folder with your simulation name. Update `configs/default_simulation.yaml` with appropriate parameters or specify with command-line flags.

    ```sh
    blobrender.simulation-luminosity
    ```

2) **Format an image or numpy file of simulation emissivity into a FITS file (necessary format for prediction step):**

    Image should be saved in `sim_data`. Update `configs/default_simulation.yaml` with appropriate parameters or specify with command-line flags.

    ```sh
    blobrender.fits-conversion
    ```

3) **Generate a measurement set from a specified telescope and observing parameters:**

    This step in independent from the previous two. Here is where you will choose the observing parameters of your simulated observation, as well as which telescope you wish to observe with. 
    Currently only the following telescopes are supported:

    - eMERLIN
    - MeerKAT
    - SKA-Mid

    Update `configs/default_MSbuilder.yaml` with appropriate parameters or specify with command-line flags.

    ```sh
    blobrender.make-ms
    ```

4) **Set up your container environment (optional, but recommended):**

    The next prediction step we recommend to do in a container. This is because the prediction requires the use of the [wsclean](https://gitlab.com/aroffringa/wsclean) software, which has specific dependencies and will only run on certain operating systems. 

    This workflow supports both Docker and Singularity containers, with a slight preference for Singularity due to it's adaptation to HPC environments.

    ```sh
    blobrender.setup-container --filetype Singularity --localfile 
    ```
    If you have wsclean installed locally and wish to run prediction without a container (at your own risk, dependencies are listed in the `containers/blobrender-dockerfile`), simply run the setup as: 

    ```sh
    blobrender.setup-container --nocontainer
    ```

    See [container support](#containers) for how to set up Docker or Singularity for the first time, and generally the [wiki page](https://github.com/katiesavard/blob-render/wiki) for more in-depth information. 


5) **Predict visibilities using the FITS file and measurement set:**

    This is the *beefiest* step. For large measurement sets we recommend performing this step on a computing cluster with more RAM than a regular desktop environment.

    This step will predict what your provided FITS file (located in `sim_data/`) image looks like with the observing parameters specified in the measurement set (located in the working directory) created from the `blobrender.make-ms` step.
    
    Update `configs/default_prediciton.yaml` with appropriate parameters or specify with command-line flags.

    ```sh
    blobrender.predict
    ```

## üê≥‚ôæÔ∏è  Containers

**blobrender** runs the prediction workflows in **Docker** üê≥ or **Singularity** ‚ôæÔ∏è containers for reproducibility and ease of installation / managing dependencies.

**See [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for installing Docker (note that on Mac OS the desktop app must be running to perform builds) and [Singularity Docs](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html) for installing Singularity (not available on Mac OS, and also may be known as [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/latest/singularity_compatibility.html) on newer systems but retains the same syntax).**


Use `blobrender.setup-container` to build or pull the required containers.

Docker and Singularity containers can be built from the files provided in `containers/` by using the `--local-file` flag. This is recommended, as **blobrender** is tested in these containers. 

If you encounter problems building locally (conflicts with user privileges), you can choose to pull a pre-built image from DockerHub where we recommend you use the [wsclean container provided by stimela](https://hub.docker.com/layers/stimela/wsclean/1.6.3/images/sha256-15718fd7303ba215829f3eca0bc04e6e28af23170a5acae6b7d6a316b2eb4bce) (Makhathini et al. 2018). This is done automatically if the `--local-file` flag is omitted. 

As mentioned in the [quickstart example](#quickstart-example), we recommend using Singularity as it plays better with HPC environments. However, Singularity is not supported on Mac OS, hence why we also provide the option to use Docker (although, we risk sounding like a broken record, but for most use cases this software is best used on HPC due to RAM requirements).

Lastly, if using Singularity, it is often the case on clusters that one does not have root privileges (no `sudo` rights) and thus can not build containers from scratch. For this reason we provided the functionality to pull a pre-built container from DockerHub, but we also provide the option to build the containers provided with blobrender (recommended option) on a remote server know as [Sylabs](https://cloud.sylabs.io/builder). 

> "Using the Remote Builder, you can easily and securely create containers for your applications without special privileges or set up in your local environment. The Remote Builder can securely build a container for you from a definition file entered here or via the Singularity CLI."
> ‚Äì [Sylabs](https://cloud.sylabs.io/builder)

To enable this functionality, you must first create an account with [Sylabs](https://cloud.sylabs.io/builder). Once you have an account, ensure you are logged in from your command-line environment by running

```sh
singularity remote login
```
This may prompt you to create an Access Token which can be obtained via the Sylabs website and should be saved in your `$HOME/.singularity/remote.yaml`, if not automatically created. Once this is set up, you can check your login status with:
```sh
singularity remote status
```

You are now clear to run the `blobrender.setup-container` command with the `--remote-build` flag, noting that this option is only available when `--filetype Singularity`.
